# Pet project

This is an old version of my pet project, created to connect React App with Express Services

In this repo there are three folders:

1.- back-end folder contains express project with database migration.
2.- front-end folder contains react app with connection to backend.
3.- common folder contain all resoruses shared between front-end and back-end.
